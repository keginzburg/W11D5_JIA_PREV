# Redux Developer Tools
Redux has its own special set of developer tools. They allow you to do things like inspect your application state in real time as you use your app, or cancel an action to see a live recalculation of the state as if that action had never been dispatched. They require only a few minutes of setup, and can be well worth the effort.

## Instructions
1. Install the [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd).

2. Install the node package onto your project.

* For webpack 3.x
````
npm install --save-dev redux-devtools-extension
````

* For webpack 4.x
````
npm install redux-devtools-extension
````

3. Make the following changes to your `/frontend/store/store.js`.
```js
  // frontend/store/store.js

  import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
  import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
  import logger from 'redux-logger';
+ import { composeWithDevTools } from 'redux-devtools-extension';

  import rootReducer from '../reducers/root_reducer';

  const configureStore = (preloadedState = {}) => (
    createStore(
      rootReducer,
      preloadedState,
+     composeWithDevTools(applyMiddleware(thunk, logger))
-     applyMiddleware(thunk, logger)
    )
  );

  export default configureStore;
```

## Use
Now that we've set up the Redux Dev Tools, let's try them out. We will use the Fruit Stand demo app as an example.

**NB**: The Redux Dev Tools do not work if you are simply viewing a local file in your browser; your site needs to be running on an HTTP server. We could make the fruit stand into a Rails app, but that sounds like overkill just to get it on a server.

1. To install a simple server, run `npm install -g http-server`.
2. Open the root directory of the fruit stand app and run `http-server`.
3. In your browser, navigate to `localhost:8080` to see the fruit stand app.
4. You should see an atom (a nucleus with electrons) icon on your Chrome toolbar, and if you've set up the dev tools correctly it should now be green. Click on it.
5. When the dev tools open, click one of the buttons on the very bottom left to open them in a new window.
6. Now try adding some fruit.

* This will cause actions to be dispatched.
* You should see those actions popping up in the dev tools.
* You can click on them to cancel them and you should see the state recalculated in real time.

The dev tools have some other handy features, so click around and explore!
